					<h3>Image tile - grid x 2</h3>
					<p>I've added image tiling classes that can hold from 2 - 4 images on 1 row with or without captions. It's reponsive, so they will collapse for smaller devices. Adding more images and changing the class name will allow for more images.</p>

					<p>As young people grow and develop through the complex, and sometimes tumultuous period of childhood to adulthood, they must navigate their way through <span data-tooltip data-width="400" class="has-tip" title="A substance deposited in bodily tissues as a store of carbohydrates. It is a polysaccharide which forms glucose on hydrolysis.">glycogen</span> and a range of major changes and personal challenges. Similar to a yacht navigating its way through difficult weather conditions, a young person is equipped and able to maintain kilojoules and their life direction towards personal success and wellbeing, should be better prepared at being able to manage these changes well through the use of mechanical energy. Ultimately, this should enable a young person to enter adulthood with a positive sense of self confidence and mental wellbeing. This will have many positive health benefits both immediately, and into the rest of a young person’s life.</p>

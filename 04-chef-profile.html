                    <p>My first job at the age of 13 was for my local newsagent selling The Herald newspaper on a busy street corner in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I was quick to realise that earning three cents a paper commission was hard work for little return, so I started selling magazines to increase my commission, taking orders from customers for their magazines and delivering them the following day with their paper. This proved more lucrative than selling just papers. The result was: my $14 a week job was now earning me $40 a week. Back in 1984 that was a lot of money and I guess that was my first experience in sales.At the age of 16, I was introduced to the world of hospitality and cooking. </p>

                    <p>Kitchen terminology was new to me but I picked it up pretty quickly. At the time I had no idea that working casually at McDonald’s while studying for my HSC would set the scene for my future career and allow me to enter the exciting world of professional cookery and food service.I was extremely fortunate to do my cookery apprenticeship with Hilton Melbourne. It was a four-year apprenticeship and the training back then was to continually rotate every three months through the six kitchen outlets of the hotel. In the late 1980s there was a kitchen brigade of about 45 chefs, pastry chefs and butchers so there was always plenty of experience to draw from. For the next 13 years I worked for various Hilton and Sheraton hotels around Australia. The next step in my culinary journey was to join Comcater Pty Ltd, of which I am still with today, an importer and distributor of the world’s best catering equipment and services. Over my 15 years I have held various roles, including demonstration chef, product management, national accounts, and sales and marketing. I am currently manager of rational Australia. I lead a national team of nine specialist rational chefs. Our goal is to pass on our knowledge of kitchen operations and offer catering solutions using rational to make the life of today’s chefs a little easier. My roles have given me the opportunity to travel the world, meet and work with many international chefs, food scientists and nutritionists, and I have seen more kitchens than I ever dreamed of – and at all times involved in an industry I love. Professional cookery and business have many simil</p>

                    <h5>Describe your role model in the industry.</h5>
                    <p>I have had many industry role models at different development stages of my career. In the kitchens it was the many European chefs that I trained under. I was culinarily inspired by the likes of Marco Pierre White, Anton Mosimann and the Roux brothers. Today Jamie Oliver, Bill Gates and Richard Branson are all great role models as they have had major influences in both their industries and the wider community.</p>

					<h2>Safety, it really is important!</h2>
					<p>Accidents are common in the kitchen but they can be avoided if we follow a few simple safety practices and take into consideration a number of safety design features. If we choose not to follow these safety practices and standards then this is when accidents will occur. It does not matter how busy we are in the kitchen or how much fun we are having, it is essential to remember to follow food safety practices at all times. Kitchen safety really is important!</p>
					
					<p>We must always consider and analyse:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>kitchen design and organisation</li>
						<li>electrical safety</li>
						<li>microwave safety</li>
						<li>food safety and hygiene</li>
						<li>preventing burns and scalds</li>
						<li>preventing falls and cuts.</li>
					</ul>


					<!-- Collaborate panel -->
					<div class="collaborate-panel">
						<h3>Let's Colloaborate</h3>
						<p>Work in groups to develop a list of the tools and equipment in your school kitchen that could be a safety risk. Explain why you think these are potential safety risks? Compare your answers with another group and see if you can add to your list.</p>
					</div>


					<h3>Contaminated?</h3>
					<p>We know that the kitchen is a common site of accidents or injuries. It is also one of the places where food can become spoiled and <span data-tooltip data-width="400" class="has-tip" title="impure by exposure to or addition of a poisonous or polluting substance.">contaminated</span> and this can result in illness to ourselves or our customer of client – the person we are making the food for. Paying attention to a number of important kitchen and personal-hygiene standard can help to prevent this from happening.</p>

					<p>As young people grow and develop through the complex, and sometimes tumultuous period of childhood to adulthood, they must navigate their way through <span data-tooltip data-width="400" class="has-tip" title="A substance deposited in bodily tissues as a store of carbohydrates. It is a polysaccharide which forms glucose on hydrolysis.">glycogen</span> and a range of major changes and personal challenges. Similar to a yacht navigating its way through difficult weather conditions, a young person is equipped and able to maintain kilojoules and their life direction towards personal success and wellbeing, should be better prepared at being able to manage these changes well through the use of mechanical energy. Ultimately, this should enable a young person to enter adulthood with a positive sense of self confidence and mental wellbeing. This will have many positive health benefits both immediately, and into the rest of a young person’s life.</p>

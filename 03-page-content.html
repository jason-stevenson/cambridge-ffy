				<p>Over half of all the fires that occur in the home are electricity related.</p>

			<p>Accidents are common in the kitchen but they can be avoided if we follow a few simple safety practices and take into consideration a number of safety design features. If we choose not to follow these safety practices and standards then this is when accidents will occur. It does not matter how busy we are in the kitchen or how much fun we are having, it is essential to remember to follow food safety practices at all times. Kitchen safety really is important!</p>
			
			<p>We must always consider and analyse:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>kitchen design and organisation</li>
				<li>electrical safety</li>
				<li>microwave safety</li>
				<li>food safety and hygiene</li>
				<li>preventing burns and scalds</li>
				<li>preventing falls and cuts.</li>

			<p>We know that the kitchen is a common site of accidents or injuries.
